Keeping you safe and secure
ING takes the security of customers' accounts, transactions and information very seriously. It�s also important for you to take all reasonable precautions to ensure that
your codes and devices for your account are not misused and remain secure and confidential.  Please remember these security guidelines:

     1.     Don�t share your Codes (Access Code, PIN, any passcode you use to authenticate a transaction on your account and any additional security code we provide
          you to conduct certain transactions � including one time passwords provided by SMS) with anyone. In some specific circumstances when speaking with one
          of our Customer Care Specialists we may request a one-time password (as reflected in your Terms and Conditions booklet).
     2.      Where you choose a Code make sure that it is difficult to guess. It should not be associated with your date of birth, Client Number, or name, or consist of
          repeated, ascending or descending characters.

     3.     If you have a Visa card on your account, don�t give it to anyone else or let anyone else use it.  If you have a virtual Visa card installed on a device, do not install
          another person�s biometric identifiers on that device or share your device access code.

     4.     Avoid using computers that are shared with other unknown people for online banking, such as internet cafes and libraries.

     5.     If you record your Code, store it in a safe place that is password protected, separate from your Client Number or any device you use to transact on the account.
     6.     Use care to prevent anyone else seeing your Codes or PIN when being entered.
     7.     ING will never send you an email asking you to click on a link to access online banking, or to provide your Access Code, Security Code or PIN.

     8.     Please check all transactions carefully. If you think or suspect that there's been an error or unauthorised transaction, that anyone else knows any of your
          Codes, or that any of your devices have been lost, stolen, or used without your permission, call us straight away on 133 464. If you don�t notify us
          immediately when you realise or suspect anyone else knows your Codes you may be liable for any transactions that occur on your account.

We can cancel any access method associated with a Code at any time without notice if we believe it is being used in a way that can cause loss to you or us, and you
may be liable for transactions on your account. You may also be liable for transactions where you or another user engage in fraud, voluntarily disclose Codes, or act
with extreme carelessness. These guidelines do not set out all the circumstances in which you may be liable for unauthorised electronic transactions. Your liability for
unauthorised electronic transactions will be determined under the ePayments Code (as reflected in your Terms and Conditions booklet).

*All Round Up to Charity transactions are donated, on your behalf, to Intelligent Foundation ABN 48 156 978 613 (a DeductibleGift Recipient). Intelligent Foundation
delivers donations to other charities. Round Up to Charity transactions debited from your account within the last 14 days of the financial year will not be included in
the current year�s total. Instead these Round Ups will be included in the following year�s total due to processing time.
The total Round Up to Charity stated on your April �June statement reflects the amount donated on your behalf in that financial year. To find out more, please see the
Orange Everyday Terms and Conditions.
